    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>When I was a kid, we often spent all day at the community pool. 
        Wed leisurely snack on popsicles and chips, until it was time for lunch. 
        No one wanted to dry off, get dressed, 
        and go home for lunch. but also suffered under the heat. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 round bread loaf</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded iceberg lettuce</li>
        <li>1/2 pound sliced deli ham</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cut a wide circle out of the bread loaf top like youre making a soup bread bowl. Carefully remove and set aside the loaf top.</li>
        <li>Hollow out the bread interior, being careful not to break through the sides. The loaf interior can be used to make croutons, so there is no waste.</li>
        <li>Melt butter with mustard in the microwave for 15 seconds in a small bowl. Mix well. </li>
